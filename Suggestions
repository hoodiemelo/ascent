Changes for later on down the pipeline:
-Develop algorithm for expected growth over time for students

To Do Later
-Add bottom 1/3 as category (along with ELLs and Sped)
--Identify poor performing students in class with respect to certain properties (Statistics)
-Add feature where students can download an excel .doc that includes students' final grades on paper; teachers can use this to quickly input grades in Jupiter
-Make it so staff members can have administrative use of site to flag kids, add kids, move kids
-Add option where teacher can select year(s) they want to see for data and/or student lists
-Make sure data follows kid, not teacher
--By moving the student from one class to another, their data is not lost
--Make sure kids don't lose data when moved from class to class or year to year
